# Akudemy

## What is it?

We take programmers who want to join a company, and help them take care of the tech aspect of the interviews.

## How does it work?

After you express interest and we gather your goals, skill level, and availability, we'll come up with a training path that aims to achieve your goals in the shortest amount of time possible, with an almost guaranteed chance of success.

This is usually done by tailoring for you a series of timed challenges that you can practice on as often as you can manage, and identifying the next step of the learning path based on the results. You'll be in communication with me on slack the entire time, and we can deal with any questions or worries as they come.

You don't pay anything for this, it's completely free: when you join a company like TopTal, I can make use of the referral bonus to keep Akudemy going. If the referral bonus can't be leveraged, I will ask you to make a donation, but only after you have been hired, so there is no risk involved for you.

## How long does it take?

It depends on a few factors:

1. your goals: getting into TopTal will be harder than passing a generic tech interview. It will absolutely be worth it, and I recommend it, but obviously your goals affect the learning path.
1. your current skill level: some students are experienced programmers who might simply need reassurance that they would pass the TopTal exams if they took them, in which case it might only take a couple hours, in which I might not find any weaknesses. Other students might want to join TopTal but not have learned a programming language yet. This is fine, they won't have high priority in my list, but I will take care of them by directing them to relevant resources, communities, and by answering their questions. Slowly I'll be able to do more frequent sessions with them until they're ready. This can take from a couple months to a couple years. Most students will fall somewhere in between: if you have more than a couple years of professional experience in freelancing, and have done occasional competitive programming, it will take you from 1-5 weeks.
1. your availability: the above assumes you can allow for roughly 1 hour of exercise every day, which might not be the case for everyone. I highly recommend spending 6+ hours a day and getting results quickly, but I understand you might not be ready to leave your current job yet, or have other commitments, or might simply not have the energy. It's all fine, we can manage accordingly.

We usually start as soon as you decide to do it. Determining the start of your learning path can be done in the middle of our first conversation, so you have something to work on right away.

## What aspects can you help with?

Most students are worried about the technical side of tech interviews, especially when "algorithms" are involved. Helping you come up with algorithms to solve a competitive programming challenge is my specialty. You'll see they usually follow a finite number of patterns, and once you learn about enough of them, you'll develop an intuition that will allow you to solve most new challenges you might face in an interview.

Other students are more worried about take-home projects and field-specific questions. I will help with that too: you'll see the majority of the work/knowledge needed for a take-home project can be minimized by hanging out in the right communities, asking the right questions, and knowing how to use search engines. If the interviewer is going to ask you something specific about the framework/library you're using, there's little for you to do there but learning those specifics. I can help you find the right resources, practice explaining certain aspects of the tool, and come up with potential question the interviewer might have. In general, I wouldn't worry about it: if the interviewer sees you're a quick learner and are familiar with some similar paradigms, they won't worry about your in-depth knowledge of a specific tool, and will welcome the thought diversity you'd add.

You might also have special concerns:
- "my english might not be good enough"
- "my microphone sometimes makes weird sounds"
- "I'm not sure joining a company that focuses on angular is a good choice for my future, what do you think?" (it can be)
- "My emotional life is in turmoil, I have a hard time focusing, but I really want this job"

It might take more time for me to handle those concerns if I haven't seen them before, but I will help you with them. We can have practice calls, you can call me right before the interview to make sure everything works, we can look at evidence for or against your choices, and I can help you find focus.

I'm here help you achieve your goal, with the resources I have available.

## What qualifications do I need?
None. Contact me if you're serious about achieveing your goal, it doesn't matter if you don't have enough experience.

It will simply take longer if you're not a professional, haven't gone to university, or haven't got past "Hello, World!", but we'll have a path for you. See the "how long does it take" section, above.

## How do I get started?

Contact me! I'd prefer you send me an email in the following format:

```
to: matei@akudemy.tech
subject: Interest in Akudemy

Hi,

I was told about Akudemy by my CompSci lecturer at XYZ, and I'm interested in
joining TopTal.

I'm focusing on JavaScript, and while I have had no professional experience
with it, I have worked on several industry-level projects with other students,
here are some links: (...).
I'm most worried about live-coding in interviews, I'm not sure what to expect.

I have just finished my Bachelors, and am currently looking for the best job I
can get, so I believe I can spend 4 hours practicing every day, with the hope
of being ready for TopTal by next week.

Thank you for your time,
David
```

Make sure it roughly mentions:
- your goals
- your current skill level
- your availability

Please let me know how you learnt about Akudemy!

## How much does it cost?
Nothing.

If you are applying to TopTal and are eligible for the referral bonus (which means it's your first time applying, and your specialty is JavaScript/Python), you and I both get 2500 usd after you pass the exams and take your first job.

If you're not eligible for referral bonuses, I would ask you to donate a matching 2500 usd, but only after you get in that company, and we can wait a little for you to get your first paycheck.

I believe everyone should have the opportunity to join high-ranking companies, regardless of their current financial situation. 

## What qualifies you to do this? Who are you?

My name is Matei Copot, and while the Akudemy community helps each other out, I'll be your main instructor.

I'm currently part of the TopTal network, you can find my resume here: https://www.toptal.com/resume/matei-copot. I'm not looking for new clients.

I've worked over a dozen of clients as a contractor, and have had to go through interviews for almost all of them, with a success rate approaching 100%. On top of that, competitive programming is a hobby: I love participating in competitions like AoC, solving interview questions for fun, submitting to game jams, and generally solving seemingly pointless problems.

You may know me from [my work on codepen](https://codepen.io/towc/), which includes my (unfinished) popular guide for jumpstarting JavaScript knowledge, [example.js](https://codepen.io/towc/post/examplejs-1-1). You may also know me as a js13kgames.com competitor, where in 2015 [flappy box](https://js13kgames.com/entries/flappy-box) was the 2nd most popular game, and it was in under 2kb.

In 2015 I also went through 2 Cambridge interviews at Queens' College, for Computer Science, and took the CSATs. My sights were set outside of academia, but even with very limited preparation, I was [pooled](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/files/publications/guide_to_the_winter_pool.pdf).

I gave talks at the JSOxford meetup, and started JSBratislava, mentoring several developers while being a key member of the now defunct Progressbar Hackerspace.

Outside my highschool diploma, my only paper qualification, when it comes to education, is a security certification called [CEH](https://cert.eccouncil.org/certified-ethical-hacker.html), acquired at the age of 16. I don't have a strong belief in the value of paper qualifications when it comes to a software engineering career.

If you have any questions about whether I can help you, email me at matei@akudemy.tech

## How can I help?

Thank you for asking!

The best action you can take is sending me more students. Link them to this page, or send me an email telling me you know someone who is interested.

If you're interested in being a coach, we can talk, however I can handle the current volume of students. You can send me an email so I can contact you in the future.

If you're a company looking for hires, you can set up a referral program similar to TopTal's, then send me an email so I can consider sending more students your way.

## Disclaimers

I am not part of the TopTal team, my association with TopTal stops at being part of their talent network.

No person or entity has paid me/Akudemy to promote them over others, outside of the incentives of the referral bonuses. I do think TopTal is a fantastic consultancy, and I would recommend it even if there was no referral bonus, but their existence make Akudemy sustainable.

My CEH certification has expired and is no longer current.
